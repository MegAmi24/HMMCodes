Patch "Always Use Homing Attack (experimental)" in "Gameplay" by "Hyper" does
/*
Uses Homing Attack instead of Chaos Attack for Shadow's main airborne attack.

Known issues;
- Many enemies lack homing impact sounds, resulting in the attack being rather quiet.
- Shadow can no longer kick Black Arms enemies into the air.
- Shadow can no longer teleport through barriers to reach enemies.
